Saturday
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10:00 am - Breathe heavily and rub my face a lot while thinking about this. 

break: 10:30-11:00 

11:00 am - first commit - beers page working and logo added 12:00 ish
- this is a lot of frustrating fun

12:51pm second commit - researched how to used our API,  played around in postman,
 and added beers.js to actions

1:30pm Captains log - delierium has set in. White whale is 404. 
deleteBeer breaks page, beers.js displays nothing, BeerView.js exists

2:20pm - no progress on getting beers to pop. 

4:00pm - 6:00pm - no brain function. stared at code and was lost for a bit.

6:00pm - evening push; relearned how to access things in an API call. 
- res.data = the response. 
- res.data.entries = what im actually trying to get to. not just res.data. >.<

7:40pm - Nevermind. API call still not working. Beers still failing to show up. 
- renameD Beers.js to BeerList.js to help clarify whats going where.
- Im 90% sure I'm not doing very well.

7:56pm - lost. going to look at the rest of the project requirements, 
- take a break, and come back to it.

8:39pm - Beers showing up. stopping for the night... or until later.

Sunday
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7:00am - not all beers have images. adding description to beers and some 
- other info to make the site interesting

              why cant i get the glass type by typing beer.glass.name
              in the same way i CAN get beer.style.short_name?

sunday 10:00am - copied all my beer docs and made breweries. breweries first 50 
- working. part one technically done. not happy with styling.

sunday 11:00am - break. looked at the pagination requirement and i dont know what to do.
- skipping it for now, and doing section 3

12:00pm-12:46 - Cant show an individual beer. now i can. 
  commit now so i can remember what i did. 

4:23pm - plugged away for a few hours. showing and individual beer and brewery. 
images working on breweries. beers dont seem to have any DB side images, 
so i didnt do anything with those. Pagination seems to be where a lot 
of people hit the skids, so i dont feel too bad in not getting it.
