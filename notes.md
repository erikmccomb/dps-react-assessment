first commit - beers page working and logo added 12:00 ish
            - this is a lot of frustrating fun

12:51pm second commit - researched how to used our API,  played around in 
              postman, and added beers.js to actions

1:30pm Captains log - delierium has set in. White whale is 404. 
              deleteBeer breaks page, beers.js displays nothing, 
              BeerView.js exists
2:20pm - no progress on getting beers to pop. 

4:00pm - 6:00pm - no brain function. stared at code and was lost for a bit.

6:00pm - evening push; relearned how to access things in an API call. 
  - res.data = the response. 
  - res.data.entries = what im actually trying to get to. not just res.data. >.<
